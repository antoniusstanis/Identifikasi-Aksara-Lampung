# the label for the images, that is all the images in each folder belong
# to the the same class, and the name of that class is the name of the folder.
# Images are assumed to be in the .png format. It is also assumed that
# each folder has the same number of images. It is NOT assumed that all images
# have the same dimensionality, but all the images will be rescaled to 32x32
# before being saved into the dataset file.
# The total number of images is assumed to be divisible by 10.

# The script will produce a file named "characters_dataset" which will
# contain the train/validation/test datasets and labels in numpy arrays.
# The file will also contain the names of all the
# image folders in alphabetic order.
